# Bringing Websites to the Firefox Marketplace 

## Description
[This site][1] is a "living document" and all the concepts, features, stories, designs, etc are currently subject to change and open to feedback and contribution.

Note: The master branch will contain the design asset files, e.g., Photoshop files, used to create this project site.

## How to Contribute
If you'd like to actively participate in the design process, the best way to do that is to participate in conversations in the [Open Issues][2]. We try to keep conversations grouped around a topic area or theme. If you want to discuss something that doesn't already have a topic, go ahead and open a new issue.

If you want to try your hand at a design solution of your own, the best way to do that is to fork this project and submit a pull request. Alternatively you can create your own design files and post them as a new Open Issue.
