# Bringing Websites to the Firefox Marketplace 

## Description
[This site][1] is a "living document" and all the concepts, features, stories, designs, etc are currently subject to change and open to feedback and contribution.

All the supporting files used to create the content for this site will be available in the master branch of this project. 

## How to Contribute
If you'd like to actively participate in the design process, the best way to do that is to participate in conversations in the [Open Issues][2]. We try to keep conversations grouped around a topic area or theme. If you want to discuss something that doesn't already have a topic, go ahead and open a new issue.

If you want to try your hand at a design solution of your own, the best way to do that is to fork this project and submit a pull request. Alternatively you can create your own design files and post them as a new Open Issue.
