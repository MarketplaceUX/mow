We've taken a modular approach to content strategy. Content we create for the home page can also be used in other locations, for example, on a category page, on the recommendations page, or on a detail page.

Our goals for content include:

* New vehicles for content display
* Create scalable editorial system
* Simplify the Editor's process of "curating" content
* Introduce space for Mozilla promotions (non-MP)
* Accomodate partner promotions

<br/>
## Content Blocks
We've broken content blocks into 3 types:

* **Single Item block**
* **Multiple Items block**
* **Do More block**
* *Note: an Item is an app, a website, a ringtone, etc.*

The 3 block types have different appearances, rules, and behavior.

| Block Type  | Display As  | Rules
| :------------- |:------------------| :-----| :-----|
| Single Item | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/blocks.html/#singlesys">System</a> | A single Item selected from the catalog by the system based on rules
| Single Item | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/blocks.html/#singlecur">Curated</a> | A single Item curated from the catalog by Editor
| Multiple Items | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/blocks.html/#multisys">System</a> | A group of Items selected from the catalog by the system based on rules
| Multiple Items | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/blocks.html/#multicur">Curated</a> | A group of Items curated from the catalog by Editor
| Multiple Items | <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/blocks.html/#multistory">Story</a> | A narrative created by Editor that provides context for multiple catalog Items
| Do More | Non-catalog content | A piece of content that assists people in learning how to do more with MP or their broader Mozilla experience


<br/>
##Sponsorship
Any block displayed as ***Curated*** or ***Story*** can be "sponsored" by a partner (or other). Sponsorship can be paid, if this is desirable to MP team. 

When a block is sponsored, it is labeled as "sponsored" to ensure that is is different from other Mozilla curated content). Examples are in progress.
