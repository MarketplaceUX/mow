**Mar 19, 2015 - Design Your Own Home Page.** Everybody designed the home page they'd like for Marketplace. [You can find the notes and images here][2].

**Mar 26, 2015 - Review home page concepts.** Good discussion about home page concepts. Several great questions came up. We're tracking those in [Issue 5][3]. You can add more questions, comments, feedback in that issue.

We'll post the images shortly, as well as revised ones based on our discussion.
