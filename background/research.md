<br/><a name="design"></a><h2 style="padding-top: 120px; margin-top: -120px;">Relevant Design Research</h2>

[Hick's Law][9] - Increasing the number of choices increases decision time logarithmically. See also [The Paradox of Choice][10].





<br/><a name="search"></a><h2 style="padding-top: 120px; margin-top: -120px;">Need for Different Models of Navigating the Web</h2>

[Search Engines through the Ages][16]

[Evolution of the Browser][14]
<br/>"The Internet of Things will drive the browser to be an invisible entity that functions more as a platform that facilitates web apps more so than the gateway to the Internet as it has been in the past. In this context, the future of the browser looks more like an operating system. But it’s really a platform."

<br/>[The Trouble with Social and the Opportunity for Google][15]
<br/>"But there are reasons to think that the whole push/discovery model is itself approaching a point of diminishing returns."

"[T]he central role will belong to whoever comes up with a better way to filter the content most relevant to our lives."

"Navigating the web these days involves a game of hopscotching a number of services, each one becoming less satisfying by the year. Our collective attention craves a better navigation system."





<br/><a name="mobile"></a><h2 style="padding-top: 130px;margin-top:-130px;">Mobile Web and Mobile Apps</h2>

[Apps and the Mobile Web][1] - Dec 2014
<br/>Some good stats about <b>perception</b> of time spent in apps vs mobile web. Note that the methodology used general Comscore data for apps vs mobile web use and then compared that against the perceptions of specific people. So it's not an apples to apples comparison. UX team believes the data is still interesting to look at.

"For mobile internet users, ease and convenience help dictate a preference for apps AND mobile web browsing. These can nudge people toward either mode, depending on the task at hand" (p26).
<br/>This aligns with our hypothesis that people seek "content" first and choose the format (app or web) that provides most ease of use/convenience.


<br/>[The Point of Influence][2] - Aug 2014
<br/>Good study about mobile shopping. It's not clear if this study was U.S.-specific or included a worldwide sample. Has some interesting observations that can help us understand the context when a user is looking for something specific. For instance:
<ul>
	<li>87% of smartphone users use mobile search at least once a day from their phone or tablet (p4)</li>
	<li>55% of mobile searches occur at a location where a desktop computer was likely to be available (p6). This aligns with our hypothesis that people with multiple devices will use the one closest to them, if that device meets their needs for the task at hand.</li>
</ul>


<br/>[The US Mobile App Report][3] - Aug 2014
<br/>General stats about app usage in the <b>U.S.</b>
