[Apps and the Mobile Web][1] - Dec 2014

Some good stats about <b>perception</b> of time spent in apps vs mobile web. Note that the methodology used general Comscore data for apps vs mobile web use and then compared that against the perceptions of specific people. So it's not an apples to apples comparison. UX team believes the data is still interesting to look at. 

The most significant observation from this study is that "For mobile internet users, ease and convenience help dictate a preference for apps AND mobile web browsing. These can nudge people toward either mode, depending on the task at hand" (p26). This aligns with our hypothesis that people seek "content" first and choose the format (app or web) that provides most ease of use/convenience.


<br/>[The Point of Influence][2] - Aug 2014

Good study about mobile shopping. It's not clear if this study was U.S.-specific or included a worldwide sample. Has some interesting observations that can help us understand the context when a user is looking for something specific. For instance:
<ul>
	<li>87% of smartphone users use mobile search at least once a day from their phone or tablet (p4)</li>
	<li>55% of mobile searches occur at a location where a desktop computer was likely to be available (p6). This aligns with our hypothesis that people with multiple devices will use the one closest to them, if that device meets their needs for the task at hand.</li>
</ul>
