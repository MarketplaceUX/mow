<i>These are hypotheses will we test as we roll out this program.</i>

<b>Specific details are less important for websites than for apps.</b> To open an app, you have to download, install, and then open the app. Because opening an app involves a lot of friction, people like to have a lot of information (e.g., description, reviews, ratings, screenshots, etc.) before they invest time and energy in doing that. 

On the other hand, opening a website involves significantly less friction - just click and it opens in your browser. For this reason, we believe people will not need as much information before they go ahead and open a website. As a result, we suspect that there will be far fewer visits to the website detail page than we see for the app detail page. We plan to measure this and respond with updated designs.

<br/><b>Community members want validation and recognition for their contributions.</b> We know that community members want these when they contribute in other Mozilla areas. Since this is a new program, we want to design a few baseline features that provide validation/recognition. That is, we want to launch with fewer of these features and build more of them as we go. So we will talk with community members about other types of validation/recognition that might be useful/interesting to them.

<br/><b>We expect that participation (submission of sites) will follow typical patterns for online participation.</b> We do not expect the numbers of people who submit websites to be markedly different from normal patterns of online participation. We will measure this as we go, so that we can build appropriate support tools when we need to, e.g., if 50% participate, we should probably build some tools.

<br/><a name="prins"></a><h2 style="padding-top: 120px; margin-top: -120px;">Design Principles</h2>

<b>Before they tap/click something, people should know what will happen next.</b> E.g., they should know that tapping an app initiates the install process, while tapping a website opens that site in the browser.

<br/><b>There are no dead-ends on Marketplace.</b> All pieces of the Marketplace experience will lead people into further exploration. 

<br/><b>Promotional spaces are baked into the experience.</b> There are no places on Marketplace that do not have opportunities for "promoting" content. We should always be offering people more content. Some of those opportunities will be reserved for partner promotions. Others will be reserved for editorial content. And many of them will be reserved for algorithmic "promotions" of content we think will interest people. This principle will become more clear as we flesh out the designs.

<br/><b>People will always know where they are in Marketplace and what they can do.</b> All parts of Marketplace will be clearly labeled with consistent use of page titles, breadcrumbs, and sub-navigation (where appropriate).

<br/><b>"List" pages will be different from one another.</b> To create a more lively and dynamic experience, "list" pages will be differentiated from each other using both different visual design and different interaction models.

<br/><b>Marketplace will adopt best practices of the modern web for sharing and sending of content.</b>

<br/><b>Marketplace will adopt best practices from the ecommerce industry.</b> In particular, Marketplace will adopt best practices for display of content, filtering, and use of promotional space.

<br/><b>Marketplace will clearly indicate off-site links.</b> We will adopt consistent use of visual indicators that tell people a link leads to an off-site page.

<br/><b>Marketplace will use friendly language.</b> We will talk to people in real-people speak and avoid any use of "tech" language.

<br/><b>Marketplace is not about "educating" people.</b> While we may include content that helps people understand a few things, our main goal is not education. We're not going to ask people to eat their vegetables. They can eat candy for dinner if that's what they want.

<br/><b>Marketplace will include a consistent and highly visible "help" system.</b> Details TBD during design process. Our goal is to provide people with an understanding of what they can do in Marketplace. We want to do that in context (vs sending them off to another page). We may also include an FAQs page and an About page for people who prefer those methods of "help."

<br/><b>Word of mouth is a powerful incentive.</b> Provide tools to assist people in getting the word out.

<br/><b>Marketplace has a point of view.</b> Marketplace is not neutral. It has a point of view that is consistent and visible on the site. Our POV will be expressed in visual design, interaction models, and language. Details TBD during design proces.

<br/><b>Marketplace is link-y.</b> Based on our [Product Design Strategy][1], we want Marketplace to jumpstart an exploration of the web. This means we want people to link to content outside of Marketplace. So it's a success if people leave Marketplace to follow a link to another site.

<br/><b>Ease burden of creating curated content for Marketplace Editor.</b> We want to create a system that allows more "set and forget" containers of curated content. This would allow Editor to focus more attention on specialized curated content.</b> 

<!--br/><b>Marketplace will become more focused on the individual person's interests.</b> The current Marketplace makes a number of assumptions about what people want to see. Much of this is done (currently) via a manual curation process. -->
