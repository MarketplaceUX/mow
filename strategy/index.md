### Currently in progress -- Our experience strategy illustrates our vision of the impact of mobile-optimized websites on Marketplace consumers. 

An experience strategy is about creating a holistic vision for a consumer's experience of your product, service, and/or brand. Our experience strategy will be based on:

* Mozilla and Marketplace goals
* Data and research
* Design principles
* The notion that whatever we build now needs to be flexible enough to scale for what we know at this moment about the future
* Clear direction for pre- and post-launch usability testing, with a plan of action for how we will respond to the results of both 

The design team creates several different kinds of documents during this phase to think through design solutions, as well as to communicate with various stakeholders, e.g., engineering and marketing teams. 

Once we've worked through the experience strategy, we'll move into Concept and Design where we'll work on the details of navigation, layout, hierarchy, interaction design, and visual design.

### <a name="designprocess"></a>A Note about the Design Process

The visual aids in this section are the tools designers use to think through a holistic experience strategy. And it's part of the process to throw out almost all of the visual aids when we've completed that thinking.

This is not wasted effort. It's how designers work. 

These visual aids are structural tools that help us organize our thinking in a logical way. They're akin to the following: 

* The throwaway code an engineer produces when creating a proof of concept
* The outline you make for a term paper
* Your to-do list

In all of these situations, the final outcome -- the launched feature, the A+ term paper, and the specific tasks you complete today -- very often differ from what the structrual tool indicated. The structural tool simply helped you organize the space in which you could tackle the problem and think it through.

But don't worry. You'll get to see "design" soon as we move into Concept and Design.
