### Currently in progress -- Our experience strategy illustrates our vision for the impact of mobile-optimized on Marketplace consumers. 

An experience strategy is about the holistic vision. It is not about specific design details. The design team uses several different kinds of documents during this phase to communicate with various stakeholders, e.g., engineering and marketing teams. <u>Some of these docs will look "designed." Ignore this - right now, we're just working through high-level design solutions. You'll get to see "design" later.</u>

### Our experience strategy will be based on:

* Mozilla and Marketplace goals
* Data and research
* Design principles
* The notion that whatever we build now needs to be flexible enough to scale for what we know at this moment about the future
* Clear direction for pre- and post-launch usability testing, with a plan of action for how we will respond to the results of both 

Once we've worked through the experience strategy, we'll move into Concept and Design where we'll work on the details of navigation, layout, hierarchy, interaction design, and visual design.
