* This page is where the user can go to get "stats" on his Website Submissions. So the content blocks will include "likes" and "visits" per website.
* If we collect this info as part of submission > review process, content blocks would also show "X other submissions," meaning 12 other people also submitted this site. It's one indicator of the website's popularity.
